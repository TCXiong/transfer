Hey there, hope you're doing well. Quick thing â€“ got my payment and noticed it's got the new Wisconsin tax rate. Weird thing is, it's taking out more than when I had the California rate. Doesn't quite add up, right? Any idea who I should chat with about this? Just trying to wrap my head around how these taxes are working. Thanks a bunch!
