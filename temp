Hey, sorry to bother you again. I noticed that the payment I received has deductions based on the new Wisconsin tax rate. Strangely, it seems to be more than what was deducted with the California tax rate. It's a bit confusing. Do you have any idea who I should reach out to about this? I'm curious to understand how the tax is calculated. Thanks!
