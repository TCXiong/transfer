Q2
Prediction for h1 and h4:
latency: latency_l1 + latency_l2 + latency_l3 = 170.049 
throughput:min(throughput_l1, throughput_l2, throughput_l3) = 
min_server_throughput = 18.94 mbps
min_client_throughput = 22.90 mbps

Measurement for h1 and h4:
latency = 168.037
throughput: 
server = 18.27 mbps
client = 22.64 mbps
