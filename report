The provided code is a Python script that integrates various libraries to create a graphical user interface (GUI) application for processing and visualizing data from CSV files, particularly focusing on the calculation of fall time, raise time, and pulse width in signal data. Let's break down the analysis into purpose, design principles, and code details.

### Purpose
1. **Data Processing**: The core functionality is to load, process, and analyze time-series data from CSV files. The focus is on signal analysis, specifically calculating and visualizing parameters like fall time, raise time, and pulse width.
2. **User Interaction**: It uses a GUI to allow users to select files, choose a save directory, and interactively process and visualize the data.

### Design Principles
1. **Modularity**: The code is organized into functions, each responsible for a specific task (e.g., file browsing, folder selection, data processing).
2. **User Interface**: Tkinter is used for the GUI, offering basic yet functional components like buttons, list boxes, and text widgets for interaction.
3. **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib is employed for plotting data, a common choice for Python-based data visualization.
4. **Data Analysis**: NumPy and SciPy are utilized for numerical operations and signal processing, which are essential for the analysis tasks performed by the application.

### Code Details
1. **Global Variables**: `selected_files`, `selected_folder`, `PW_ns`, `Raise_ns`, `Fall_ns` are used to store data across different functions.
2. **File Operations**:
   - `browse_button()`: Lets the user select CSV files and updates the GUI list box with selected file names.
   - `select_folder_button()`: Lets the user select a folder for saving outputs.
3. **Data Processing - `process_files()`**:
   - Loads data from CSV files using NumPy.
   - Performs signal analysis to calculate fall time, raise time, and pulse width.
   - Uses linear interpolation for more accurate time calculation at specific intensity thresholds.
   - Saves calculated parameters to a file in the selected directory.
   - Visualizes data and calculated parameters using Matplotlib.
4. **GUI Components**: 
   - `Tk`, `Label`, `Listbox`, `Button`, `Text` widgets are used to create the interface.
   - Instructions and file selections are displayed in text and list boxes.
   - The main window is set up with a title and specific geometry.
5. **Event-driven Programming**: The GUI operates on event-driven principles, where functions are called in response to user actions like button clicks.

### Areas of Improvement / Considerations
1. **Error Handling**: The script lacks robust error handling, particularly for file reading and data processing.
2. **Code Optimization**: The script could be refactored for better efficiency and readability.
3. **Functionality Expansion**: Additional features like more detailed signal analysis or support for different file formats could be added.
4. **User Interface**: The GUI design is basic and could be improved for a better user experience.
5. **Documentation and Comments**: Adding more comments and documentation would make the code more maintainable and understandable.
