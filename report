The updated script is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application for data processing and visualization. It uses `Tkinter` for the GUI, `Pandas` for data manipulation, `NumPy` for numerical calculations, `SciPy` for interpolation, and `Matplotlib` for plotting. This script is designed to read data from two Excel files, perform interpolations, calculate peak power, and then plot the results. Let's break down the analysis into purpose, design principles, and code details.

### Purpose
1. **Data Importing**: The script imports data from two Excel files. The first file contains the main data, and the second file provides additional data points for interpolation.
2. **Data Processing and Interpolation**: It performs interpolations using different methods (linear, PCHIP, Cubic Spline) and calculates peak power from the measured power and interpolated duty cycle.
3. **Data Visualization**: The script plots duty cycle and peak power to visually represent the processed data.
4. **User Interaction**: The GUI allows users to select the data files and execute the processing and plotting functions.

### Design Principles
1. **Modular Design**: The script is organized into functions, each handling a specific task such as file browsing, data processing, or plotting.
2. **Use of Libraries**: It efficiently uses external libraries for specific tasks - `Pandas` for data handling, `NumPy` for numerical operations, `SciPy` for interpolation, and `Matplotlib` for plotting.
3. **GUI-Based Interaction**: The use of Tkinter makes the application interactive and user-friendly.

### Code Details
1. **Global Variables**: `selected_file_path` and `selected_file_path_2` store the paths of the selected files.
2. **File Operations**:
   - `browse_file()` and `browse_file_2()`: Functions for opening file dialogues to select the data files. The selected file paths are displayed in the GUI.
3. **Data Processing - `process_data()`**:
   - Reads data from Excel files using `pandas`.
   - Performs interpolation using linear interpolation, PCHIP, and Cubic Spline methods.
   - Calculates peak power and saves the results to an Excel file.
   - Plots duty cycle and peak power using `matplotlib`.
4. **GUI Components**: 
   - `Button`, `Label`, and `mainloop()` from Tkinter are used for creating the interface.
   - The GUI allows file selection and triggering of the data processing function.
5. **Event-Driven Architecture**: The application responds to user events, such as button clicks, to execute corresponding functions.

### Areas of Improvement / Considerations
1. **Error Handling**: The script could benefit from more robust error handling, especially for file reading and data processing.
2. **User Feedback**: Providing feedback, such as success messages or error alerts, would enhance the user experience.
3. **Data Validation**: Adding checks to ensure the correctness and compatibility of the imported data could prevent potential runtime errors.
4. **Documentation and Comments**: The code could be more thoroughly commented to explain its functionality, making it more maintainable and understandable.
5. **GUI Layout and Design**: The current GUI layout is basic and functional; it could be improved for aesthetics and usability.
