[PPTA Inspection]

Objective: Investigate the decrease in PPTA with an increase in pulse width.

Methodology: PPTA is calculated as safetymap divided by totalpower. Notably, as total power increases, PPTA decreases. Conducted multiple test samples and verified the outcome through result comparisons.
[Fall Time Calculation Script]

Objective: Develop a script for fall time calculation using the gradient method.

Challenge: Initial attempts revealed an unacceptable level of bias.
Action Steps:

Received a MATLAB script from Romain and executed it online for verification. Noted the necessity to modify input data by eliminating the instruction part in the CSV file.
Python Script Adaptation:

Developed a Python script based on the MATLAB file.
3.1 Extraction Process: Successfully extracted time, intensity, and smooth intensity.
3.2 Optimization: Employed various Gaussian filters to minimize discrepancies between the Python and MATLAB versions of the script.
