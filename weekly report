GUI Optimization:
  *Redesigned the precheck window layout for improved usability
  *Restructured several notification windows to allow for resizing and scaling of components, resulting in a cleaner look
  *Developed a new GUI for the measurement window to enhance user experience

Backend Improvements:
  *Reconstructed the API functions within the measure.py file to increase flexibility for developers, 
allowing for single measurement function invocation such as measuring rise time and other parameters.
