[Fall Time Calculation Script]
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for the fall time calculation script, incorporating a browse button to simplify the selection of test files by users.
- Enhance the fall time calculation script to enable the plotting of two curves within a unified graph. This modification aims to facilitate a comparative analysis of their respective characteristics.
- Integrate comprehensive instructions into the script, ensuring users are guided effectively through its functionalities and usage.

[mzp transient curve plot]
- Assist William in generating MZP transient curves by adjusting the script.
- Due to an incompatible data format for the algorithm, I developed a preprocessing script to generate appropriately formatted data files. These files can then be utilized to produce the MZP transient curves.
- Integrate new functions into the script for calculating relaxation times.

[Miscellaneous]
- Scheduled a meeting with Jean to review the advancements in the automation software for the oscilloscope. Explored strategies for integrating the Tektronix oscilloscope with the software program.
