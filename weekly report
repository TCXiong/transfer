[Fall Time Calculation Script -- (Python Script Adaptation)]

[mzp transient curve plot]

- Assist William in generating MZP transient curves by adjusting the script.
- Due to an incompatible data format for the algorithm, I developed a preprocessing script to generate appropriately formatted data files. These files can then be utilized to produce the MZP transient curves.
- Integrate new functions into the script for calculating relaxation times.

[Miscellaneous]

- Scheduled a meeting with Jean to review the advancements in the automation software for the oscilloscope. Explored strategies for integrating the Tektronix oscilloscope with the software program.
